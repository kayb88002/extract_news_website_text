      "\"There are a lot of modalities that needs to be discussed and most of the stakeholders feel that with IPL being held in April, there is very little time for a mega auction and to have a uniform retention policy, agreeable to all the existing franchises,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have to invite tenders and have a bidding process ready. In case you have two teams winning bids in late January or early February, they need to be given time for auction which can then be held only in March. That leaves a new team with very little time to plan,\" he added.\n",

      "NEW DELHI : They have won the IPL title rights for this season but whether fantasy gaming platform Dream11 hold on to that for the next two editions will depend on how high they raise the bid as the BCCI is unwilling to settle for the current offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to BCCI sources, this is precisely the reason why the board has not yet officially announced Dream11 as IPL title rights holder even though league chairman Brijesh Patel confirmed this on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company replaced Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Vivo, which had to pull out for this season because the Sino-India border stand-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources said BCCI and Dream11 are still negotiating on the conditional three-year bid under which the company is supposed to pay ₹240 crore each in 2021 and 2022 if Vivo doesn't make a comeback with its yearly ₹440 crore deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was always clear that the highest bidder may not get the title rights (it was specified by the BCCI before accepting the Expression of Interest from bidders),\" a veteran BCCI official, privy to the development, told PTI on conditions of anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having said that, Dream11 has bid the highest and are still favourites to get it, a few issues are still being ironed out before an official announcement comes,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is learnt that BCCI is in discussions with Dream11 to revisit their second and third year bids and wants them to increase the amounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's for only year 2020, then ₹222 crore works fine. But it was a conditional bid for three years. We still have our deal with Vivo on,\" he said.\n",

      "Secretary Jay Shah will be the alternate director as well as India's representative at the Chief Executive Committee meets of the global body.\n",

      "It was learnt that most of the stakeholders feel that having a nine or 10-team IPL in 2021 will be a hasty decision with the new franchises getting very little time to build a competitive team, PTI reported on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are a lot of modalities that needs to be discussed and most of the stakeholders feel that with IPL being held in April, there is very little time for a mega auction and to have a uniform retention policy, agreeable to all the existing franchises,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have to invite tenders and have a bidding process ready. In case you have two teams winning bids in late January or early February, they need to be given time for auction which can then be held only in March. That leaves a new team with very little time to plan,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 10-team IPL means 94 games and nearly two and half month window which can throw the international calender into disarray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the availability of the top foreign players for the entire duration of the IPL needs to be ensured and the broadcast money per year which is for 60 matches also needs to be re-negotiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, Star India pays ₹16,347.50 crore for a period between 2018-2022 and till date it was for 60 matches per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the biggest names who seem to be interested in buying teams include business tycoons Gautam Adani and Sanjeev Goenka (erstwhile owner of Rising Pune Supergiants).\n",

      "NEW DELHI : They have won the IPL title rights for this season but whether fantasy gaming platform Dream11 hold on to that for the next two editions will depend on how high they raise the bid as the BCCI is unwilling to settle for the current offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to BCCI sources, this is precisely the reason why the board has not yet officially announced Dream11 as IPL title rights holder even though league chairman Brijesh Patel confirmed this on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company replaced Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Vivo, which had to pull out for this season because the Sino-India border stand-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources said BCCI and Dream11 are still negotiating on the conditional three-year bid under which the company is supposed to pay ₹240 crore each in 2021 and 2022 if Vivo doesn't make a comeback with its yearly ₹440 crore deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was always clear that the highest bidder may not get the title rights (it was specified by the BCCI before accepting the Expression of Interest from bidders),\" a veteran BCCI official, privy to the development, told PTI on conditions of anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having said that, Dream11 has bid the highest and are still favourites to get it, a few issues are still being ironed out before an official announcement comes,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is learnt that BCCI is in discussions with Dream11 to revisit their second and third year bids and wants them to increase the amounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it's for only year 2020, then ₹222 crore works fine. But it was a conditional bid for three years. We still have our deal with Vivo on,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We haven't closed it as it's a pause. If we are getting ₹440 crore, why will we settle for ₹240 crore?\" the official asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, Dream11 has two options -- either to accept a one-year or rather four months 13 days deal of ₹222 crore or increase the conditional amount for 2021 and 2022, which is their discretion.\n",
